This code is released under the libpng license Authors and maintainers: libpng versions 0.71, May 1995, through 0.88, January 1996: Guy Schalnat libpng versions 0.89c, June 1996, through 0.96, May 1997: Andreas Dilger libpng versions 0.97, January 1998, through 1.5.4 - July 7, 2011: Glenn Binary incompatibility exists only when applications make direct access to the info_ptr or png_ptr members through png.h, and the compiled application is loaded with a different version of the library. DLLNUM will change each time there are forward or backward changes in binary compatibility (e.g., when a new feature is added). See libpng-manual.txt or libpng.3 for more information. The PNG specification is available as a W3C Recommendation and as an ISO Specification, http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-PNG-20031110/</p></lo>

<lo><p>SQLite<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from SQLite version 3.7.14. By combining all the individual C code files into this single large file, the entire code can be compiled as a single translation unit. This allows many compilers to do optimizations that would not be possible if the files were compiled separately. Performance improvements of 5% or more are commonly seen when SQLite is compiled as a single translation unit. This file is all you need to compile SQLite. To use SQLite in other programs, you need this file and the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines the programming interface to the SQLite library. (If you do not have the "sqlite3.h" header file at hand, you will find a copy embedded within the text of this file. Search for "Begin file sqlite3.h" to find the start of the embedded sqlite3.h header file.) Additional code files may be needed if you want a wrapper to interface SQLite with your choice of programming language. The code for the "sqlite3" command-line shell is also in a separate file. This file contains only code for the core SQLite library.</p></lo>
