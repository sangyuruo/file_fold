# The build.properties file can be created by you and is never touched
#  by the 'android' tool. This is the place to change some of the default property values
#  used by the Ant rules.
#  Here are some properties you may want to change/update:

#  application.package
#       the name of your application package as defined in the manifest. Used by the
#       'uninstall' rule.
#  source.dir
#       the name of the source directory. Default is 'src'.
#  out.dir
#       the name of the output directory. Default is 'bin'.
#
#   Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should be updated
#    using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

#    This file is an integral part of the build system for your application and
#     should be checked in in Version Control Systems.
